# Solar - A global, decenteralized computing platform, with a pure proof of stake cryptocurrency.

## **NOTE** This cryptocurrency and computing platform is still under heavy development, and is only working as an alpha and probably won't be finalized for a while.

#### **Build web API's** (using serverless functions), run **machine learning models** and much more with **minimal fees**, or **get paid** by distributing your own **computing power** to the network.

This is the NodeJS implementation of the Solar VM and protocol.

To run a node, do `npm install` in the terminal and once all the dependencies have been installed, run `npm run node` to start your node.


#### **What is Solar**
Solar (and the different SolarVM implementations) provides a way for people to distribute their own computing power to a **global network** for anyone to run programs on, and get **paid (with SOL)** while doing it. 

Of course, if different users want to run their own **computing tasks**, they can choose to do it via uploading a **SolarScript** by itself or by deploying a **flask** - a containerized computing task with access to state variables and uploading files.
