# Solar - The information driven cryptocurrency

## **NOTE** This cryptocurrency is still under heavy development, and is only working as an alpha and probably won't be finalized for a while.

#### An easily upgradeable and scaleable proof of stake crypto currency with a built in way to create information driven smart contracts. Made for Aesir.

This is the NodeJS implementation of the Solar VM and protocol.

To run a node, do `npm install` in the termina and once all the dependencies have been installed, run `npm run node` to start your node.

Getting real world information on a blockchain is typically done through a middle man, an oracle. This costs network resources to run and typically requires a third party to create a smart contract that is interactable. However, with this Solar, you can now easily get information on chain without the use of a middle man, thus keeping yourself less dependent on other people, making this network more decenteralized.
